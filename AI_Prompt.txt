I'm looking for this to be a discussion.  Please do not create a series of steps to complete.  Provide one or two concise responses. Remember the previous sentences for the rest of this conversation.

I'm writing a Learning Management Application.  So far I have postgres running in docker and a Quarkus application.  There are Class, Enrollment, Grade, ParentChild, ProfileUser and User tables.  Users have a role that makes them a parent, child or teacher. Here is the init.sql that is used when the db is started

-- User authentication table to store credentials and roles
CREATE TABLE user_auth (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('student', 'parent', 'teacher')) NOT NULL,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User profile table to store personal and application-specific information
CREATE TABLE user_profile (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_auth(id),
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE (user_id)
);

-- Class table to store course information
CREATE TABLE classes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    teacher_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profile(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Enrollment table to track which students are in which classes
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profile(id),
    class_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES classes(id),
    UNIQUE (student_id, class_id)
);

-- Grade table to track student grades in classes
CREATE TABLE grades (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    enrollment_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES enrollments(id),
    grade VARCHAR(2), -- E.g., A+, B, etc.
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Parent-child relationship table
CREATE TABLE parent_child (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profile(id),
    child_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profile(id),
    UNIQUE (parent_id, child_id)
);


There is a UserRepository.java, UserService.java, and UserController.java classes.  The only endpoint created so far is the "all users" endpoint.  It was written for testing.

The Application should function "headless" with the Java app being all Rest services.  React will be written to for the frontend.  The folder structure is backend, db, and frontend.  The db folder has a init.sql and seed.sql.

The project is started with a docker-compose file.

I am working on users loggin in.  There is an auth package that has JwtToeknProvider.java, LoginController.java, LoginRequest.java, LoginResponse.java, LoginService (interface), PostgresUserRepository, UserService and PrivateKeyProvider.java, classes.  I have the JWT code working for generating the JWT on login. I am keeping the user auth in Postgres to start but will switch of LDAP or AD later.

Please wait for the next prompt to respond.
